PREDICTION MODELS FOR CUSTOMER CHURN IN SYRIATEL TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY

**BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING**
The project endeavors to develop a predictive model for customer churn, with the primary objective of identifying customers who may be inclined to discontinue services. Stakeholders within the telecommunications industry, including marketing and sales teams, customer service departments, and upper management, stand to benefit substantially from the outcomes of the project. The project scope includes the development and evaluation of predictive models with the potential to significantly enhance customer retention and overall profitability of telcos.

**Overview of the Project**
SyriaTel, a leading telecommunications firm, grapples with a customer 'churn' problem. The churn problem poses revenue and reputation risks to the company. To address this, SyriaTel seeks predictive insights and a reliable classifier model to anticipate customer churn effectively.

Specific Objectives:
1. To develop a binary classification model to predict whether a client will imminently terminate their relationship with SyriaTel.
2. Identify the factors influencing customer churn.
3. Select the optimal model for forecasting customer churn.

**DATA UNDERSTANDING**
The dataset originates from SyriaTel Telecommunication company and was obtained from Kaggle (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset/data). It comprises 21 columns and 3333 rows. The columns have various attributes related to customer demographics, service usage, and churn behavior. The rows correspond to a recorded customer. The dataset encompasses both continuous and categorical variables. The target variable identified is "churn," with the remaining variables serving as predictors, excluding "state" and "phone number."
